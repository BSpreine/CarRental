<H2>Car Rental</H2>
<h3>Perscholas Case Study</H3>

The goal of this project was to simulate that
of a luxury car rental site.

Tools and languages used in the developement of this project
are; SpringBoot, Java, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Thymeleaf, Lombok,
Spring Security, JPA, and MySQL.

API inclusions in the project for weather have been implemented
in order to add to the functionality and visual of the website
as well as to help aid the user in car rental decision by knowing the
current and upcoming weather conditions.

I've included the diagram of the database below to show the flow of
information and each connection.
